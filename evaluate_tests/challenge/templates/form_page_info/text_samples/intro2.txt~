<code explanation>
In C, strings are denoted by "char*". If you see a parameter like "char* input" in one of the code snippets you are given, then the variable "input" is a string. Strings in C can be indexed, starting at 0, to set or retrieve a specific character. The code snippet below, which uses the function "strlen" to calculate the length of a string in characters, demonstrates some of the ways you might see strings come up during the challenge.

<textarea explanation>
The input format you will use for strings is a bit different than for integers. Instead of a single number, each input will consist of a sequence of characters surrounded by quotation marks. If char* input = "hello world", then strlen(input) = 11 and input[1] = e. If char* input = "", then strlen(input) = 0 and input[0] will produce an error. Use the text area below to experiment with different inputs into "func_one", each input on its own line, and click "Evaluate Inputs" to see what outputs are produced.
